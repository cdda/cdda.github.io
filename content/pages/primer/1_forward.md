Title: Forward

It needn't be said that no person could have foreseen or predicted recent events. Arguably *more unlikely* however, are those that have led to the passage of this tome, the so-called "Codex Apocalyptica", into your possesion. Nevertheless, *by way of you reading this message*, there can be no doubt that you are now inextricably tied to its on-going survival. **And no doubt it, to yours.**

Value is a concept that falls short to describe the contents of the Codex. Originally penned by one nameless badass and amended by dozens of others, the sheer volume of untold despair and horror that has paid for these lessons to endure need no allusion. This far in the storyline no one should need a lesson in perspective.

Survivor! The voices of countless forgotten souls swept away flatfooted by that for which there was no possible preperation implore you!

*You are now responsible for the **Codex Apocalyptica!***
