Title: Taking Stock

The very first priority in survival is understanding one's circumstances. In order to make a plan that is both beneficial and likely to succeed its important to know both the current state of things and where you want to go. Only then can you make preparations to actuate the change you desire.

Its the apocalypse, so your motivations should at some level be pretty basic. At minimum it'd be nice to stay alive, eh? Beyond that, if living can be made a little "easier" and "comfortable" than you have probably accomplished more than most can hope to achieve.

Staying Alive
-------------

In more mundane circumstances the difficulty of this task can vary wildly. Today, we just have various levels of ridiculous and impossible. That said, assuming you are not trampled by a moose, bitten by a zed, photographed by an eyebot, infected by a fungaloid, flayed by a mi-go or emulsified by a hulk, then life can be fairly prosperous in the Cataclysm.

Basic Needs
-----------

It should come as no surprise that beyond direct dangers that its going to take a lot of work to keep your body and mind in shape in order to face those dangers. You'll need a regular supply of food and water to sustain you. The weather can get harsh and if you happen to be in New England where I am now, Winter can be just as you-ending as any Hulk. You'll need shelter of some sort to stay warm and avoid illness. Some measure of defensive capability is required. Ontop of all of that, you'll need some way to keep your mind busy and entertained to keep composed.


SI Bionics
----------

One of your biggest friends out there is going to be that little flex-display embedded into your arm. You may not have payed much attention to "Standard Issue Bionic" before the Cataclysm but it is now as indispensible as the air you're breathing. I assume you already know how it works but with invaluable functions like navigation aids, constitution monitor and personal cargo inventory, it doesn't matter what your ethical quibbles regarding bionics are - you'll be relying on it constantly.
