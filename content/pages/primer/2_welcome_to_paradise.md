Title: Welcome to Paradise

So you've decided you'd like to live.

Must be the case if you're reading this. That or you're some future historian attempting to recount how it can be possible that there *is* a future wherein historians exist to look back at all of this. Yeah alright, wildly optimistic. But, who could blame you? You've made it far enough to somehow obtain this mess of papers. And noone can find it if I don't write it!

Look, I'm not a genius. I'm not even an expert. At anything. But I have made it this far. And I have learned quite bit since it all began. I've enjoyed skilled company and I've read a garbage bag of textbooks. Nothing about enduring this world is simple or easy and the mundane and routine are unforgivably deadly. This book is certainly not a warranty on life. As I'm myself now learning, no amount of preperation or accounting or fail-safing or backup-planning is sufficient..

The world is *too* undone.

But one thing we likely share, beyond our ability to look across time and understand some of each other's experience, like the moon's beauty or the horrors of the apocalypse, is our resolution that life is better than death. And with that, I begin to write what I know before I too am (literally) inched off the precipace. :(
